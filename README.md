Homework 1
The most common commands that I will be using will likely be creating branches with git checkout -b <branchname>
Adding files with git add, and using git commit to commit said files.
Using git push origin to send my changes in.
I imagine that git merge will be useful once it is clear that any changes to my code do not break it.
I am sure that more uses become apparent once I get the hang of working with Git
